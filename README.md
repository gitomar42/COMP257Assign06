Assignment 06 Reinforcement Learning


2. The rationale of the activation functions &amp; the loss function used in the network

Activation Functions :
ReLU - is efficient for non-linear activation of hidden layers
Linear for Q-Values - activation in output layers of unbounded Q-Values

Loss Function :
Mean Square Error(MSE) : Minimizes the squared difference between predicted and target Q-Values

6. Challenges Faced during Training and potential strategies for further improving the agent's performance

Challenges in Training :
-Balancing Exploration and Exploitation
-Delays between actions and rewards

Strategies for Improving
-Bias reduction : Addressing over estimation
-Maintaining separate networks for multiple sets of Q-Values&
